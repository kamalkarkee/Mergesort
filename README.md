# Mergesort
Implementation of mergesort using linked list ideas for tables.

Write a program to read an input sequence and then produce an array of links giving the values in ascending order. The
first line of the input file is the length of the sequence (n) and each of the remaining n lines is a non-negative integer. The
first line of the output indicates the subscript of the smallest input value. Each of the remaining output lines is a triple
consisting of a subscript along with the corresponding input sequence and link values.
